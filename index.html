<h1> Sir Alex ferguson</h1>
<p >The team's most successful manager was Sir Alex Ferguson and he was United’s manager from 1986-2013. He is considered one of the greatest managers of all time having won more trophies(38) than any other manager. He won 13 premier league titles, 5 fa cups and 2 UEFA champions leagues in his time at Manchester United. Manchester United has struggled to find a stable manager since the retirement of Sir Alex Fergusson.  The team played 1500 matches under him between 1986-2013.  However, they have experimented with 5 managers since then but havent found a stable solution yet.  David Moyes, who succeeded Sir Alex lasted only one season.  Ryan Giggs was a caretaker manager for a few matches and made way for Louis Vaan Gaal from Netherlands, who was the coach for two seasons but the results were not satisfactory. Manchester United hired Jose Mourinho, a celebrated Potuguese manager in 2016.  Even he had to leave in the middle of his third season due to poor results.  Then came the current manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.  He has now been with the team for more than two seasons and the results have improved. They finished 3rd in the 2019/20 season behind Liverpool and Manchester City and at the halfway mark of the current season, they are leading the point table with a reasonable shot at being EPL champions after a decade.&#9917	</p>
