The son of rugby union and Wales international rugby league footballer Danny Wilson, Giggs was born in Cardiff but moved to Manchester at the age of six when his father joined Swinton RLFC. Predominantly a left winger, he began his career with Manchester City, but joined Manchester United on his 14th birthday in 1987. He made his professional debut for the club in 1991 and spent the next 23 years in the Manchester United first team. At the end of the 2013–14 season, he was named as Manchester United's interim player-manager following the sacking of David Moyes. He was named as assistant manager under Moyes' permanent replacement, Louis van Gaal, on 19 May 2014; he retired from playing the same day holding the club record for competitive appearances – 963. At international level, Giggs played for the Wales national team 64 times between 1991 and 2007 and was named as the captain of the Great Britain team that competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

<h1>Paul Scholes</h1>
<p>With United, Scholes won 25 trophies including 11 Premier League titles (more than any other English player) and two UEFA Champions League titles. Paul Scholes (/skoʊlz/ SKOHLZ; born 16 November 1974) is an English football coach and former player, as well as a co-owner of Salford City. He spent his entire professional playing career with Manchester United, for whom he scored over 150 goals in more than 700 appearances between 1993 and 2013. His first managerial position was at Oldham Athletic, for 31 days in February and March 2019. He is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation and one of the greatest Manchester United players of all time.[3][4][5]

Scholes came through the Manchester United youth academy as one of Fergie's Fledglings (a group of players recruited by Manchester United under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson). Scholes made his full debut for Manchester United in the 1994–95 season. He went on to make 718 appearances for United, the third-highest number of appearances by any player for the club. Scholes announced his retirement from playing in May 2011 and was appointed as a coach at Manchester United. However, he returned to playing in January 2012, and went on to play one more season for the club before retiring again in May 2013.[

<h1>Wayne Rooney</h1>
<p>With Manchester the precocious young striker quickly became one of the most popular football stars in the United Kingdom, as well as fodder for the country’s notorious tabloid industry along with his girlfriend (later his wife) Coleen McLoughlin. The couple’s late-night exploits and home life were widely disseminated by the press, and McLoughlin (Coleen Rooney from 2008) was able to parlay her exposure into a media career.

Rooney was named England’s Young Player of the Year in each of his first two seasons in Manchester. In 2006–07 he helped lead United to a Premier League championship and a victory in the Carling Cup. He was a key contributor to United’s Premier League and Champions League titles in the 2007–08 season, which were followed by the team’s first FIFA Club World Cup championship, with Rooney scoring the only goal in United’s 1–0 win in the tournament final. Rooney and Man U won a third consecutive league title the following season. In 2010 he was named both the Professional Footballers’ Association Player of the Year and the Football Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year as the best player in English football for the 2009–10 season. Rooney was a part of United’s league-title-winning squads in 2010–11 and 2012–13, and during the 2011–12 season he scored a personal-best 27 Premier League goals. He continued to be the team’s top goal scorer in many of the following years, although United failed to win any major titles over that span until the club captured the first FA Cup of Rooney’s career in 2016. In January 2017 Rooney scored his 250th goal for United, passing Sir Bobby Charlton to become the club’s all-time leading scorer.</p>
